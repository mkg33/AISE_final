## :bulb: Abstract

Learning solution operators of PDEs on arbitrary domains accurately and efficiently is a critical yet challenging task in engineering and industrial simulations. While numerous operator learning algorithms exist, a trade-off often arises between accuracy and computational efficiency. This work introduces the Geometry-Aware Operator Transformer (GAOT) to address this gap. GAOT integrates novel multiscale attentional graph neural operator encoders and decoders with geometry embeddings and (vision) transformer processors. This combination allows GAOT to accurately map domain information and input parameters to robust approximations of PDE solutions. Furthermore, several implementation innovations ensure GAOT's computational efficiency and scalability. We demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over various baselines across a diverse set of PDE learning tasks, including achieving state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale three-dimensional industrial CFD dataset.

## :gear: Installation

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv-gaot
    source venv-gaot/bin/activate  
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Ensure PyTorch is installed according to your system's CUDA version if GPU support is needed.*
    
    For PyG-related packages (e.g., torch-scatter), run:
    ```bash
    pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+${CUDA}.html
    pip install torch-cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+${CUDA}.html
    ```
    Replace ${CUDA} with your CUDA version (e.g., cu128, cu121 or cpu).




## :floppy_disk: Dataset Setup

Organize your datasets (typically in NetCDF `.nc` format) in a directory structure like the one shown below. Dataset related to this paper can be downloaded from the [HuggingFace Page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shiwen0710/Datasets_for_GAOT). You will specify `your_base_dataset_directory/` in the configuration files. For example, put your data into the `datasets/` folder.

``` 
.../datasets/
    |__ time_indep/
        |__ Poisson-Gauss.nc
        |__ naca0012.nc
        |__ ...
    |__ time_dep/
        |__ ns_gauss.nc
        |__ ...
```
## :open_book: How to Use

### Configuration

All experiment parameters are managed via configuration files (JSON or TOML format) located in the `config/` directory.

**Key Configuration Parameters:**

* **`dataset.base_path`**: Path to `your_base_dataset_directory/` where your `.nc` files are stored.
* **`dataset.name`**: Name of the dataset file (e.g., "Poisson-Gauss" for "Poisson-Gauss.nc").
* **`setup.train`**: Set to `true` for training, `false` for inference/testing.
* **`setup.test`**: Set to `true` for testing/inference (typically used when `setup.train: false`).
* **`path`**: Defines storage locations for checkpoints, loss plots, result visualizations, and the metrics database.

For a comprehensive list of all configuration options and their default values, please consult: `src/core/default_configs.py`.

#### Model and Trainer Selection

**Updated Unified System** - GAOT now uses a simplified, unified trainer system with automatic coordinate mode detection:

* **Trainer Selection (`setup.trainer_name`):**
    * **`static`**: Unified trainer for time-independent datasets (automatically detects fx/vx coordinate mode)
    * **`sequential`**: Unified trainer for time-dependent datasets with autoregressive prediction capabilities

* **Model Selection (`model.name`):**
    * **`gaot`**: Unified GAOT model supporting both 2D/3D coordinates and fx/vx modes

**Sequential Data Configuration** (for `sequential` trainer):
* **`dataset.max_time_diff`**: Maximum time steps for sequential training (default: 14)
* **`dataset.stepper_mode`**: Prediction mode - `"output"`, `"residual"`, or `"time_der"` (default: "output")
* **`dataset.predict_mode`**: Testing mode - `"autoregressive"`, `"direct"`, `"star"`, or `"all"` (default: "autoregressive")
* **`dataset.metric`**: Evaluation metric - `"final_step"` or `"all_step"` (default: "final_step")

The system automatically detects coordinate mode (fixed/variable) from your data, eliminating the need for manual specification. Example configurations can be found in the `config/examples/` directory.

### Training

To train a model, run `main.py` with the path to your configuration file:

```bash
python main.py --config [path_to_your_config_file.json_or_toml]
```
For example:
```bash
python main.py --config config/examples/time_indep/poisson_gauss.json
```
To run all configuration files within a specific folder:
```bash
python main.py --folder [path_to_your_config_folder]
```

Other `main.py` Command-Line Options:

* `--debug`: Enables debug mode (may alter multiprocessing behavior).
* `--num_works_per_device <int>`: Sets the number of parallel workers per device.
* `--visible_devices <int ...>`: Specifies CUDA devices to use (e.g., `--visible_devices 0 1`).

Training artifacts (checkpoints, logs, plots, metrics) will be saved to the directories specified in the `path` section of your configuration.

### Inference
To perform inference with a trained model:
1. Update your configuration file:
   * Set `setup.train: false`.
   * Set `setup.test: true`.
   * Ensure `path.ckpt_path` correctly points to the desired model checkpoint (`.pt`) file.
2. Execute `main.py` with the modified configuration:
   ```bash
   python main.py --config [path_to_your_config_file.json_or_toml]
   ```
